WATCHiT-Reflection-App
======================

Application tht collects data from the WATCHiT application and vizualises it for the user to help promote reflection. 

Currently we rely on google-services-lib, sherlock ationbar lib and a switch plugin lib. When I get the time I will reorganize the
file structure of the git repo and add these libraries to git to avoid alot of manual set up when cloning.
